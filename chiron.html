						The modern workforce is shifting towards more people choosing full time self employment. There will be 42 million self-employed workers in America alone by 2020. Multitasking is an essential part of modern work life, and especially for self-employed individuals. However, multitasking is unavoidable and costly for productivity.

						At this stage we needed to define both the audience and the context. Because of these challenges and trends, we saw an unique opportunity to create a tool for <b>self-employed information workers</b> who need to <b>multitask</b> and switch between different engagements on a regular basis. 
					</div>

					<div class="about-desc">
						<h1 class="title">What we learned</h1>
						<ol class="insights">
							<li class="insights">The opportunity cost of blocking distractions is high</li>
							<div class="about-desc">
							Many people have commitments which require them to always be available, and thus can’t just simply block out all the communications channel. This ties back to the point about multitasking we discussed at the beginning of the presentation. </div>
							<li class="insights">High degree of multitasking and context switching</li>
							<div class="about-desc">
								We also learned that self-employed people like Erin, especially freelancers, have a tendency to multitask and switch context often. They do so because they are on their own most of the time, which requires them to manage multiple different types of work.
							</div>
							<li class="insights">Productivity is highly personal</li>
							<div class="about-desc">
								We also learned that productivity is very personal, and this is seemingly true for everyone, not just self-employed people. We found this out when we asked people what is a productive day for them, and the answers are all over the places.
							</div>
							<li class="insights">Existing tools are not tailored for multitasking</li>
							<div class="about-desc">
								Most productivity tools on the market are not tailored for unpredictable work patterns that require frequent context switching. Even fewer try to address the issue of multitasking.
							</div>
						</ol>
					</div>

					<div class="about-desc">
						<h1 class="title">Competitive analysis</h1>
						We looked at existing productivity and context management softwares to analysize existing solutions that tries to address this problem. The list includes Microsoft Focus Assist, Cold Turkey, FocusMe, Hocus Focus, Mindful Browsing, OmniFocus, and others. What we learned is that most of these products tries to address productivity and multitasking by <b>blocking out distractions or preventing users from context switching.</b>

						<br><br>

						One standout was the Virtual Desktop functionality on Windows 10. But what we realized was that Virtual Desktop is not often used by users because it is very time consuming to create and sort applications into the different desktops. We saw an opportunity to introduce AI as a way of automating this process. Specifically <b>Virtual Desktop does context switching very well, but context building is time consuming, and they don't tackle context keeping at all.</b>

					<div class="about-desc">
						<h1 class="title">Defining the strategy</h1>
						At this point we needed to generate ideas that fulfills the following roles — they need to address the problem of multitasking for our target audience of self-employed individuals. The product needs to be distinct from similar competitors. The design needs to be aligned with the use case of our user persona Erin. Based on the competitive analysis, we determined that the product needs to be able to build context quickly, keep the context, and also switch between these user-built contexts.

						<h2>What we tested</h2>
						Our objective for this prototype was to validate both the design concept, as well as the core features. So we created a video for participants to validate our design concept. The video follows the day in the life of a typical Chiron user - Ricardo, a freelance architect. I defined the specific story within the prototype, and advocated for the core features.

						<div class="about-desc">

							<h2>What we did</h2>
							We made a number of changes to the prototype in this iteration. We included a plugin marketplace to provide further personalization to the platform. We reworked the summary page and changed it to "last opened applications". We also updated the visual design using Microsoft's Fluent design system. Since Chiron is being branded as a Windows feature, it made sense for us to leverage the existing design system of Windows.

							We interviewed four participants in total to perform four main tasks. The prototype consisted of a "main application" in which you could view the timeline and project archive, and a "quick view" mode where you could create and switch between different activity containers.

								The final deliverables were passed off to Mike Premi from Intel's Artificial Intelligence Innovation Lab for future development. Mary Czerwinsky and Shamsi from Microsoft Research showed interest in the findings we uncovered, and we are in the process of passing off the findings to Microsoft as well.
								<br><br>
								The following are some highly requested features that we didn't have time to implement into the V1 since they did not directly align with one of our three design pillars of Build, Keep, or Switch.

										<h2>Voice control</h2>
									Voice controlled system was a highly requested feature. We envision users speaking to Chiron as if it was the personal assistant. This way people could spend less time manually entering commands. It would also allow you to task switch while multitasking at your home office or shared workspace. </div>

										<h2>Share & export</h2>
									All of our users wanted a way to share and export the files and contexts created using Chiron, or include a way to collaborate with other teammates, take over a project, or take turns working where one person can see what the other person did with an activity archive and the ability to return to previous versions when necessary.</div>

										<h2>Multimedia memos</h2>
									Our users really liked the memos feature. So much that they want to add more than just text and voice as memos. So we are exploring ways to support adding files, images, videos as memos. </div>

								<h1 class="title">Reflection</h1>
								<h2>Storytelling through personas</h2>
								We faced a lot of difficulty communicating the idea succinctly. Using Erin's real life story and experience as a vehicle for explaining the concepts was much more effective.
								<br><br>
								<h2>Using data to guide product and design</h2>
								Our users wanted a lot of different things, we learned to use data gathered from both ethnographic studies, and usability tests to narrow down on which features we should prioritize and which ones we should leave behind.
