			<h1 class="title">The fine print</h1>
			<div class="about-desc">The final cost of the trebuchet came out to be $11.23 for the whole build. However we learned from prototyping that this activity is best completed in a group. We found the ideal group size to be three 3-5th grade students, which would lower the cost to under $4 per student per kit.<br>
			</div>

			<div class="about-desc">As part of the kit, we also created a comprehensive instruction booklet for teachers. The booklet includes step-by-step instructions on how to assemble the trebuchet, has information on how to set-up the Arduino and accelerometer to connect to the trebuchet body.

					The kit also has the following constraints; it needs to contain suitable data visualization (software) and physical computing (hardware) components; the kit needs to be constructed from material that is readily available in a classroom; the kit should only make use of tools that can be found in the classroom; it should cost at most $10 USD per student.

Immediately after ideation, we got hands on and constructed low-fidelity prototypes to get in front of students in order to validate the design concepts. We tested the prototypes with a group of 2-5th graders. The tactility was the focus for this round of prototyping.

			However, our partner from Microsoft strongly advised us to pursue either the turbine or the speaker, because he feared that the trebuchet activity would descend into chaos and detract from the educational value.</div>

			<div class="about-desc">All three of us were excited about the trebuchet as a design concept despite the pushback, and the feedback we received from the other stakeholders gave us the conviction to push on with the trebuchet as our candidate. At this stage, our design challenge shifted to that of <b class="stem">stakeholder buy-in</b> by making sure that the trebuchet activity is manageable in a classroom environment.</div>

			<h1 class="title">Mid-fidelity prototype</h1>
			<h2>What we tested</h2>
			<div class="about-desc">
			We created a Wizard of Oz prototype that simulated the experience of the activity. In this iteration, a fake accelerometer was attached to the arm of the trebuchet to "measure" the speed of the projectile. The experiment allowed the participants to change the position of the fulcrum along the "arm" and "base" of the trebuchet. The trebuchet this time was created from lasercut plywood for additional stability, and the digital worksheet was created using Figma. We also provided a paper worksheet to help record the data across trials.

					<li>Adding and removing weights was time consuming but exciting</li>
					<li>The participants didn't find the digital visualization to be valuable</li>

				<br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Change the weight holder to a bucket shaped design</li>
					<li>Provide visual assembly and operation instructions</li>
					<li>Digitize the tracking of trial data and variables and remove the paper worksheet</li>
				</ul>

			<h1 class="title">Validation in a real classroom</h1>
			<h2>What we tested</h2>
			<div class="about-desc">We got the opportunity to test our prototype with eighteen 4th graders at Kokanee Elementary. We provided students with construction kits made from laser-cut cardboard pieces designed for assembly in groups of 3. We wanted to see if the activity would be engaging and educational, or descend into chaos.</div>

				During the post-activity discussion, we conducted a quiz. The students demonstrated very clear understanding of the relationship between kinetic and stored energy. The overall experience was fantastic, and we received some very valuable insights.
				<br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Students were able to assemble the trebuchet in much less time than we expected.</li>
					<li>The activity was a perfect fit for the 4th grade curriculum, as the students learned about stored & kinetic energy in class just 1 month prior.</li>
					<li>The pouch design was difficult to operate, resulting in frequent launch failures.</li>

			<h1 class="title">Final prototype - Physical construction</h1>
			<div class="about-desc">The construction so far used laser-cut cardboard as the material. This material would be optimal due to its weight, stability, and cost for a commercialized kit. However, the typical elementary school classroom would not have access to a laser-cutter. Inspired by origami, we opted for a papercraft trebuchet body instead, one that could be constructed using card stock.
