						<h1 class="title">The Situation</h1>
						<div class="about-desc">
<!-- 							The frontend development and design team were required to build out responsive enrollment sites that are available for whitelabeling for healthcare provider clients.
							<br><br>
		 					Each client requested different features to be made available on these deployment sites. As a result of this, implementing each one of these customized sites required a significant amount of effort from the development team. 
		 					<br><br>
							At the same time, the main mobile app for Noom Coach supported more than 15 different screen sizes. With the large variance in mobile screen sizes, it was quickly becoming tedious for us to specify those interactions manually every time a feature needed to be pushed out. -->
						</div>



						<h1 class="title">Problems Discovered from Research</h1>
						<div class="about-desc">
<!-- 	 					To address this problem, the proposed solution was to establish a shared style guide which documents the behaviour, state, and visuals of each UI element. Providing a coherent, and scalable style guide allowed us to maintain the visual language throughout the different workflows, while significantly reducing the development time required for each deployment. -->
	 					</div>

						<h1 class="title">Goals</h1>
						<div class="about-desc">
						• Aligned with actual user expectations
						• Surface affordances by providing appropriate signifiers
						• Make the tool usable out of the box
	 					</div>

						<h1 class="title">Design Responses</h1>
						<div class="about-desc">
						• Surfacing the value of factors
						• Custom factors
						• Preset idea views
	 					</div>

						<h2>Different options explored</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
	 					I always design from a moodboard. The moodboard is formed from a variety of different sources - competitive analysis for what's out there already, conventional interaction design patterns that users would be familiar with, other adjacent experiences that may be applicable. In other words, a mishmash of different prototypes are often frankesteined together to produce the end result.
	 					</div>

						<h2>Cut for time</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
	 					Strict deadline to hit sales targets for the 2nd quarter of 2020, features needed to be cut from the MVP. Iterations post launch were needed to get them going
	 					</div>

						<h1 class="title">Iterations made post launch</h1>
						<div class="about-desc">
	• Quantitative feedback was managed by the PM assigned to the project to monitor usage - reduce barriers for adoption
	• Custom scoring 
Qualitative feedback was gathered through multiple forms - surveys from Chameleon as well as user research to gather testimonials on what needed to change to increase adoption - usability testing of new features. 
						</div>

						<h2>Collaboration with other teams</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
							A lot of the work that went into this was me Slacking people asking, "Hey X interaction does the same thing as Y interaction - what's the rationale for having two separate patterns?" 
							<br><br>
							I would check in with our mobile engineers regularly when creating new interactions on whether an existing interaction pattern could be reused. In addition, I made sure to document all the redesigned interactions and where they're most appropriate in our internal development Wiki - so engineers could copy the snippets of the interaction patterns. 
							<br><br>
							During our weekly design reviews I would report on the progress - engineers and designers would then pitch in to see whether the interactions I've documented or consolidated actually makes sense for the function they were prescribed to do. PMs would occasional pitch in to make sure the interactions we are designing are applicable for the whitelabelled version of the app. 
						</div>

						<h1 class="title">Final Outcome</h1>
						<div class="about-desc">
<!-- 							The design system style guide was distributed in two ways - we had a printable version pinned up with all our interaction flows. Each of the specific components and interactions were created as ready-to-use (and interactive) modules using React and placed in our internal development wiki at Noom.  -->
						</div>

						<h1 class="title">Takeaways</h1>
						<h2>Designing from a system will save design and development efforts</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
							Use a mix of qualitative and quantitative evidence gathered through research to align stakeholders and build empathy for the user.
						</div>

						<h2>Designing from a system leads to a better end user experience</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
							Strong focus on collaboration with PM and development leads to success - devs should be involved in these usability testing calls when permissible to build empathy.
						</div>

						<h2>Build small, launch quickly, design iteratively</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
							Strong focus on collaboration with PM and development leads to success - devs should be involved in these usability testing calls when permissible to build empathy.
						</div>

						<h2>Test early and often</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
							Get insights early on while exploring different options to derisk presented solutions, be more confident and knowledgeable in one's approach.
						</div>

<!-- 						<h2>Vector assets</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
						Would it be feasible if we got rid of every single PNG in the app and replaced them with SVGs? What started as an ambitious experiment became a reality.
						<br>

						Lingo was instrumental in streamlining the hand-off process. It provides developers access to the assets in SVG and PNGs of different scales.
