						<h1 class="title">The Situation</h1>
						<div class="about-desc">
							Roadmunk is a high-growth startup whose bread and butter offering is a software solution that allows customers to easily and quickly create visually stunning roadmaps. I joined Roadmunk in December 2019 as a Product Designer. 
							<br><br>
		 					However, at the time the organization was faced with three major problems with the core offering for roadmapping.
							
							<br><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Roadmapping is a monthly if not seasonal ritual, resulting in low user stickiness</li>
								<li>The tech stack upon which roadmapping is built is slow to ship and slow to use</li>
								<li>No defined audience - when you design and build for everyone you design for no one</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							The combination of these problems results in a life-time value of just 4 years for the average subscriber, and a lot of churn for the business. 
							<br><br>
							<div class="inline-image">
								<img class="image" src="app/img/fim-diagram.png" tabindex="0">
								<p class="caption">Customer feedback are collected, ideas are prioritized before they are promoted into features.</p>
							</div>
							<br><br>
							The business hypothesis was the following - introduce a new product area that will be tailored specifically towards the workflow of Product Managers, that's built upon a modern techstack. The solution will assist Product Managers in their day to day duties, increase stickiness, and reduce churn. This was named the "Feedback and Idea Management" project team, or "FIM" for short. 8 months after the project kickstarted, I joined the team. 
						</div>

						<h1 class="title">Problems Discovered from Research</h1>
						<div class="about-desc">
		 					One of the first things we did after joining the team was to conduct a series of 1-hour user research sessions. The participants composed of both existing and prospective customers. The format included semi-structured interviews as well as usability testing sessions to evaluate both product-market fit, as well as the ease of use of the prototype. Up until this point, the product prototype had not been evaluated against live users.

							<br><br>

							<ol class="insights">
								<!-- Insight #1 -->
								<li class="insights">Actual experience ≠ user mental model</li>
								<!-- Uncovered the workflow did not resonate with how the PMs are used to working. For example, the canvas experience -->
								<div class="about-desc">
									<div class="row">
										<div class="about-desc">
											The values assigned to the factors also change depending which view the user is on. There is no source of truth across teams and factors.
											<br><br>
											In addition, product managers familiar with the RICE framework know that the RICE score is calculated as Reach x Impact x Confidence ÷ Effort. The way the score is calculated here doesn't follow said formula.

							<!-- Invested in low value features that added friction to the workflow. The value proposition was to be quick - but this -->
								<div class="about-desc">
									<div class="row">
										<div class="about-desc">
											The custom factors were far too customizable in areas that provided little value - like being able to tweak the colour and shape of the rating factors. The preset factors also didn’t accurately correlate with the data they were supposed to represent.

											<img class="image shadow" width="400" data-action="zoom" src="app/img/custom-factor-before.png" tabindex="0">

										<div class="about-desc">
											For a user to start finding value in the idea prioritization module, they need to...add the new ideas manually, customize the board to include the factors they need for the prioritization, then assign factor values for each idea individually.

						<!-- Our approach instead of redesign -->
						<!-- Align solutions with actual user mental models to improve product market fit -->
						<!-- Minimize CS efforts for teaching and onboarding in favour for a self serve experience for users -->
						<!-- Worked with PM to arrive at the right metrics to define success process and metrices to gather feedback -->

						<h1 class="title">The Redesign</h1>
						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
							<ul>
								<li>Align the designed solution with actual user mental models.</li>
								<li>Surface affordances by providing appropriate signifiers to increase discoverability.</li>
								<li>Make the Idea Prioritization module a tool that's usable out of the box instead of requiring setup to realize value.</li>
							</ul>
	 					</div>

	 					<!-- Constraints -->
	 					<!-- Limitations with BluePrint -->
	 					<!-- Morale was a huge issue, rapport -->
	 					<!-- Pre-built functionality -->

						<h2>Cut for time</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
	 					The project at this stage has been in development for over 8 months, the MVP scope needed to be trimmed due to business needs. The final deadline was set to be right before the start of 2020 Q2 so sales could hit their targets without missing oppportunities for two whole quarters. A large set of "essential" features had to be cut from scope. Iterations post launch were required to bring the product more inline with the customer needs.
						<br><br>
						A lot of trade offs had to be made to balance a solution that's sellable and usable, while maintaining velocity. 2 work weeks was all I had to redesign the entire module while balancing the need to satisfy both user as well as business goals. 
	 					</div>

						<h2>Different options explored</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
	 					I always design from a moodboard formed from a variety of different sources - competitive analysis, conventional interaction design patterns that users would be familiar with, and other adjacent experiences that may be applicable. In other words, a mishmash of different prototypes are often "frankensteined" together when I design.

						<h2>What we ultimately launched</h2>

	 						The final iteration below went through several rounds of internal stakeholder feedback, while taking into consideration the business goals and technical constraints. User feedback was also incorporated to land on the final iteration. The total redesign from research to launch were completed under 3 months.

						<!-- As a business we've decided as a financial model to constraint the amount of options people use. Have 2 default boards, 5 factors, so we want to measure how many were created, how many factors were made, so we wanted to use this. Custom scoring was created from a combination of different sources - chameleon tool tips, user Feedback, to arrive at the solutoin. The metrics were not meeting expectations - investigation into several things. The pricing model didn't work for people - reviewer vs collaborator since reviewers. The feature was launched bare bones even.  Tlka bout these problems that were discovered, and that's why we decided to launch after. -->

						<h1 class="title">Continued Design and Development After Launch</h1>

						<div class="about-desc">
							A mix of quantitative and qualitative feedback was gathered to determine where to take the product area post-launch. Quantitative feedback was managed by the PM assigned to the project to monitor usage - we learned that the manual entry created barriers for adoption. 
							<br><br>
							Qualitative feedback was gathered through multiple forms - surveys from Chameleon as well as user research to gather testimonials on what needed to change to increase adoption. I ran a mix of moderated (Zoom & Figma) and unmoderated (using Maze.design) usability testing sessions to evaluate desirability and usability of new features.

									<div class="row">
										<div class="about-desc">
											Only preset boards (RICE and Value vs Effort) had scores attached to them at the time of launch. The ability to support scoring on custom views was cut for scope before the MVP deadline. I worked with the product and engineering team to ship, test, and launch the custom scoring feature right after the launch of the MVP. I tested low-fidelity prototypes of the feature with 17 different users (mix of moderated and unmoderated tests) prior to handing off the designs to engineering — all of which were completed under 4 weeks.

								<li class="insights">Import ideas through CSV</li>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="about-desc">
											From quantitative data we noticed a low usage and adoption rate for idea prioritization after the product area was launched. User research uncovered one of the reasons why there was low adoption rate - user data already lived elsewhere, and since manual entry was the only way to add the data into the system, the amount of effort required for migration wasn't worth the value added. WIP, assets to come.

If someone is in your app and you have a feature - they will use a feature despite of it being a bad experience. Zoo - gorilla with a defalted ball - it's bad but that's all they've gone. When working with PMs when it comes to how people can get through a workflow - error rate is low. Working with CS, what % got through, time it takes to get through. A lot of metrics were business oriented. Bunch of issues -->

						</div>

						<h1 class="title">Takeaways</h1>
						<h2>Strong collaboration with product and engineering leads to focus and success</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
							Despite the timeline challenges and problems the project faced, a lot focus was put into relationship building with both product and engineering to ensure our goals are aligned. Devs and PMs were involved whenever possible in usability testing calls to build empathy for the user.
						</div>

						<!-- Collaboration -->
						<!-- Broken telephone, not the right stakeholders were in the room. First I contributed to the chaos, but then we learned. -->

						<h2>Build and ship in increments, embrace bias to action</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
							Scope is negotiable but the minimum amount of value the product needs to deliver to satisfy customer needs are not. One of the biggest 
						</div>

						<h2>Test early and often</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
							Get insights early on while exploring different options to derisk presented solutions. This allows teams, not just designers to be more confident and knowledgeable. Removing ambiguity is key to shipping quickly. 
						</div>

<!-- 						<h2>Vector assets</h2>
						<div class="about-desc">
						Would it be feasible if we got rid of every single PNG in the app and replaced them with SVGs? What started as an ambitious experiment became a reality.
						<br>

						Lingo was instrumental in streamlining the hand-off process. It provides developers access to the assets in SVG and PNGs of different scales.
