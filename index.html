																<h2>The Situation</h2>
																<div class="about-desc">
																	I began my work term at <a class= "underline" href="https://uken.com/" target="_blank">Uken Games'</a> CloudBreakers team at the beginning of 2016. This coincided with the Q1 Alpha release. Up until this point all feedback had been internal. The team decided to elicit external feedback from end users and other game developers to validate the decisions made.<br><br>
																</div>

																<div class="row">
																	<img class="image" data-action="zoom" src="app/img/uken.jpg" >
																	<p class="caption">A typical Friday at Uken.</p>
																</div><br><br>

																<h2>Design objectives</h2>
																<div class="about-desc">
																	<ul>
																		<li>Creating a product that provides the player with a pleasant and intuitive experience.</li>
																		<li>Designing with accordance to budget and timeline constraints.</li>
																		<li>Designing systems that are compatible with past builds and in accordance with game design specifications, while keeping scalability in mind.</li>
																		<li>Designing the product with the end user’s satisfaction and needs as the primary motivation.</li>
																	</ul>
																</div>

																<h2>Options explored</h2>
																<div class="about-desc">
																	During the ideation process, I worked with my mentor and the game designer to flesh out the specifications and requirements of the system. The Dossier is used to showcase player progression by tracking their achievements and unlockables in the game.
																	<div class="row inline-image">
																		<img class="image" data-action="zoom" src="app/img/cb-brainstorm2.jpg" tabindex="0">
																		<p class="caption">Whiteboard ideation</p>
																	</div>

																	After decision on a general direction and understanding what the player expectations are, explorations on the different ways of executing on the requirements took place using low to mid fidelity mocks. These mocks are drafted up quickly using placeholder images and grayscale colours to prioritize speed over form.
																	<div class="row inline-image">
																		<img class="image" data-action="zoom" src="app/img/cb-low-fidelity.png" tabindex="0">
																		<p class="caption">From pen and paper to Sketch.</p>
																	</div>

																	Ultimately a decision was made to eliminate all but one of the candidates from the low fidelity mocks. The column based representation of the achievements proved to satisfy our design needs the best. The rationale for this is because it is unlikely that there would be more than 5 achievement categories for the players to track. By displaying all of the achievement progresses in a horizontal fashion, the player is presented with all of the key information they need. It was deemed unnecessary to have an "detailed view" for each achievement category since the information presented in the details panel is repetitive.

																	<p class="caption">TL: Overworld Nameplate. TR: Dossier Overview Interface. BL: Player Profile Arena Information. BR: Crafting Interface. </p>
																</div>

																<h2>User testing</h2>
																<div class="about-desc">
																	Luckily my work term coincided with the Alpha playtest of CloudBreakers. The UX team had concerns in some of the general game design and gameplay directions. But in order to make our arguments more concrete we required validation in the form of external user feedback. <br><br>

																	Flinto and Zeplin were used to do the heavy lifting, these tools vastly improve the speed at which the team was able to complete and collaborate on tasks. Flinto allowed us to quickly build out interactive (90% functional) prototypes extremely quickly, with full featured workflows and animations. Zeplin streamlined the transition from design to engineering by turning mockups into interactive design specs, enabling developers to generate assets and style code directly. <br><br>

																	The UX team suggested that a closed beta would provide valuable user feedback for the studio. The playtest was designed in the form of a Longitudinal Diary user studies, and over 50 users participated in the playtest. <br><br>
																	TypeForm.com was used to produce the playtest diary questions, and we enlisted help from UserTesting.com for feedback in the form user-emotion and user-behaviour videos (along with gesture recordings). <br><br>

																	I was also granted the opportunity to speak in person with some of our users. What was especially valuable for me in this experience was being able to digest and dissect their comments from both a logical and emotional standpoint.
																	</div>
																	<div class="row inline-image">
																		<img class="image" data-action="zoom" src="app/img/user-research.jpg" tabindex="0">
																		<p class="caption">We broke down the data so we could correlate commonalities between the participants before presenting the findings to the entire team.</p>
																	</div>

																	<h2>Design challenges</h2>
																	<div class="about-desc">
																		One of the core concepts of UX design requires the system designed to be as intuitive as possible, with minimal thinking required on the user’s part when navigating through the interface and interactions. <br><br>

																		Keeping these core ideas in mind, the designs needed to be simple to use, simple in implementation, potentially scalable and also delivered in a timely fashion due to the pressing budget and timeline.<br><br>

																		On a few occasions, the game design and UX design team would come into disagreement with the direction or the implementation of certain features. <br><br>

																		Under these circumstances what usually ended up happening were collaborative brainstorm sessions. The teams would dissect the problem at its roots, and the points of discussion usually revolved around why a specification or implementation is necessary and whether it will bring value to the end users. <br><br>

																		In some ways UX design and game design have opposing principles — game design want to create friction within game systems, since that provides an avenue to increase profit. On the other hand, UX designers actively work to minimize friction.
																	</div>

																	<h2>The outcome</h2>
																	<div class="about-desc">

																		Big shoutouts to the CloudBreakers team for having so much faith in me! Especially to my mentor & supervisor Brian Lin.
																	</div>
																	<h2>Tools used</h2>
																	<div class="about-desc">
																		<ul>
																			<li>Vector graphics are edited using Adobe Illustrator</li>
																			<li>High fidelity mocks done using Adobe Photoshop</li>
																			<li>Low fidelity mocks done using Sketch</li>
																			<li>Animations done in Adobe AfterEffects</li>
																			<li>Prototyping done using Flinto</li>
																			<li>Hand-off process performed in Zeplin</li>

							<li class="insights">The opportunity cost of blocking distractions is high</li>
								<div class="about-desc">
								Many people have commitments which require them to always be available, and thus can’t just simply block out all the communications channel. This ties back to the point about multitasking we discussed at the beginning of the presentation. </div>
							<li class="insights">High degree of multitasking and context switching</li>
								<div class="about-desc">
								We also learned that self-employed people like Erin, especially freelancers, have a tendency to multitask and switch context often. They do so because they are on their own most of the time, which requires them to manage multiple different types of work.
								</div>
							<li class="insights">Productivity is highly personal</li>
								<div class="about-desc">
								We also learned that productivity is very personal, and this is seemingly true for everyone, not just self-employed people. We found this out when we asked people what is a productive day for them, and the answers are all over the places.
								</div>
							<li class="insights">Existing tools are not tailored for multitasking</li>
								<div class="about-desc">

						</div>

						<div class="about-desc">
						<h1 class="title">Competitive analysis</h1>
						We looked at existing productivity and context management softwares to analysize existing solutions that tries to address this problem. The list includes Microsoft Focus Assist, Cold Turkey, FocusMe, Hocus Focus, Mindful Browsing, OmniFocus, and others. What we learned is that most of these products tries to address productivity and multitasking by <b>blocking out distractions or preventing users from context switching.</b>

						<br><br>

						One standout was the Virtual Desktop functionality on Windows 10. But what we realized was that Virtual Desktop is not often used by users because it is very time consuming to create and sort applications into the different desktops. We saw an opportunity to introduce AI as a way of automating this process. Specifically <b>Virtual Desktop does context switching very well, but context building is time consuming, and they don't tackle context keeping at all.</b>

						<h1 class="title">Defining the strategy</h1>
						At this point we needed to generate ideas that fulfills the following roles — they need to address the problem of multitasking for our target audience of self-employed individuals. The product needs to be distinct from similar competitors. The design needs to be aligned with the use case of our user persona Erin. Based on the competitive analysis, we determined that the product needs to be able to build context quickly, keep the context, and also switch between these user-built contexts.

						<h2>What we tested</h2>
						Our objective for this prototype was to validate both the design concept, as well as the core features. So we created a video for participants to validate our design concept. The video follows the day in the life of a typical Chiron user - Ricardo, a freelance architect. I defined the specific story within the prototype, and advocated for the core features. Mengxiao and Sakshat created the prototype using Figma, and I produced the video using AfterEffects.

						<h1 class="title">Usability testing</h1>
						<h2>What we did</h2>
						After receiving the feedback, we made a number of changes to include into the mid-fidelity prototype. The objective for this phase was to flesh out the interaction design and test the specific execution of the features. 
						<Br><Br>
						We made a number of changes to the prototype in this iteration. We included a plugin marketplace to provide further personalization to the platform. We reworked the summary page and changed it to "last opened applications". We also updated the visual design using Microsoft's Fluent design system. Since Chiron is being branded as a Windows feature, it made sense for us to leverage the existing design patterns of Windows. 
						<Br><Br>
						We interviewed four participants in total to perform four main tasks. The prototype used for Usability Testing was created by Mengxiao in Principle. The prototype consisted of a "main application" in which you could view the timeline and project archive, and a "quick view" mode where you could create and switch between different activity containers.

						<div class="about-desc">
						Also, we received feedback that the functionalities of these two parts were overlapped, but the visual inconsistency made them look like a light theme and a dark theme for a same thing. Because of this, we merged the overlay and the main application together in our high fidelity prototype. After that, these two parts became the main page view, and the activity archive view using the same visual language.
						<br><br>
						Our participants really couldn’t agree on whether the timeline should go left to right or right to left, and we received nearly 50/50 split on the “right” direction of the timeline. So instead we decided to orient the timeline from top to bottom instead, with top being the most recent.

							In the high fidelity prototype, we incorporated the learnings from the two previous rounds of testing, and consolidated the features to address the three design objectives of context building, context keeping, and context switching. Since the terminology is repetitive, we renamed them as "environment building", "context keeping", and "activity switching". 
							<br><br>
							We revisited Erin's story, and the final prototype is done from the point of view of Erin, who needs to balance her managerial work with personal obligations. Erin is planning her wedding and honeymoon, in addition to tracking the status of her employees and clients.

							The final prototype was created using Adobe AfterEffects by Khai Nguyen, with Sakshat and Mengxiao responsible for the assets used in the video. I was responsible for the content, script, and the technical documentation.
