					<div class="about-desc">
						The invention of new media technologies has had a huge effect on the entertainment industry. We went into this with a particular interest on how major studios plan and organize their activities on production. We wanted to investigate specific opportunities that leverage mixed reality and in particular HoloLens as a design intervention. We dove into the 5-month research phase by conducting competitive analysis, literature review, and recruiting experts that have worked on major motion pictures. 
						<br><br>
						Through synthesis of the ethnographic data collected, we generated a number of research insights. From these insights and core product qualities from competitive analysis, we generated three major themes for research findings. We believe the product should help film-makers with:
						<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Understanding spatial constraints</li>
							<li>Visualizing virtual objects</li>
							<li>Addressing business needs</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						The research report found below is the culmination of 10 weeks of research work done on the project. We presented the physical report to the Mixed Reality at Work (MRW) team at Microsoft. The findings in the report was used by the design and prototyping team to flesh out a functional prototype to demonstrate how mixed reality could be used to assist the filmmaking process. The outcome of the design and prototyping phase could be found on <a class="underline" href="https://www.surabhiwadhwa.com/hololens">Surabhi Wadhwa's portfolio here.</a></div>

								<h2>Miniature 3D set</h2>
							People see the world in 3D. Current pre-visualization tools used on computers and phones only depict a 2D version of this 3D world. We see a huge opportunity in the form of a holographic tabletop miniature 3D model of the set that could be used in pre-production. We envision a Hololens application that would provide the director with a birds-eye view of the production setup in order to plan the movement, scale, and positioning of characters, objects within a scene. </div>

								<h2>Spatial location mapping</h2>
							While location scouting, production designers and location managers can scan a space using the Hololens or capture 360 video and photos of the location and from this render a 3D model of the indoor or outdoor space. This built to scale 3D model serves as a communication for the film crew by showcasing the spatial limitations of the set, leading to better alignment, planning, and organization during production.</div>

							Another promising opportunity we identified is helping actors and the camera crew visualize computer generated characters and objects that would be added in post-production. Actors could wear the Hololens to rehearse with a CGI hologram and match eye-lines before shooting a scene. This application of the Hololens could also be used by the camera crew to pull focus on a CGI character or object and reduce the number of plate shots captured.</div>

								<h1 class="title">Background</h1>
								Technology has impacted the filmmaking industry in the past few years. From George Lucas to Robert Rodriguez, technology has been adopted to drive the industry in very different directions. 
							<br><br>
								Recently, there has been a huge interest from filmmakers in immersive technologies. Steven Spielberg used the HoloLens while building the VR cinematic universe of Ready Player One, and James Clyne the director of photography used a VR headset to assist him in filming Solo.

								<h1 class="title">Film production process</h1>
								We jumped into this by first understanding the film production process. What we learned is that filmmaking consists of five stages, but the majority of technology advancements have been focused around post-production transcendence.

								We saw this as a potential opportunity to focus on improving the pre-production and production phase of filmmaking using mixed reality. Therefore we set out to speak with experts and participants that hold ownership over the pre-production and production phases of filmmaking - namely directors, producers, cinematographers, and VFX artists.

								<h1 class="title">Research participants</h1>
								Diversification of participants is key for our project. We looked for triangulation across different stakeholders. Pain points identified by multiple participants helped us narrow down areas where MR could be most effective as a design intervention.
							<br><br>
								We identified that it is important to speak to participants that work on the production of major motion picture films, as well as independent filmmakers such as art and documentary filmmakers.

									In today’s world, the films produced tend to have a stronger push towards commercial success. As the production cost of movies has progressed exponentially in the past decade, the complete process of filmmaking leaves very little room for error. Contingencies during production can be devastating. Hence, time and budgets are paramount, which leaves limited room for experimentation of techniques and tools. Moreover, the value of new tools and technologies need to be self-apparent.

Access to time, knowledge, resources, and room for experimentation with this tech is directly correlated to the size of the budget. The use of this tech in filmmaking is not a standardized process across the industry. The precedence has been set by Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, and other few directors in Hollywood. But the knowledge of these tools is limited to these few production houses. This lack of understanding of how new media technology functions and its benefits is not apparent to smaller production houses, leading to less adoption.
