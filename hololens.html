						Initially we set out to investigate ways of improving personal productivity, more specifically — how users defined productivity, what contributes to a focused state, and what distracts people.

							<li class="insights">The opportunity cost of blocking distractions is high</li>
								<div class="about-desc">
								Many people have commitments which require them to always be available, and thus can’t just simply block out all the communications channel. This ties back to the point about multitasking we discussed at the beginning of the presentation. </div>
							<li class="insights">High degree of multitasking and context switching</li>
								<div class="about-desc">
								We also learned that self-employed people like Erin, especially freelancers, have a tendency to multitask and switch context often. They do so because they are on their own most of the time, which requires them to manage multiple different types of work.
								</div>
							<li class="insights">Productivity is highly personal</li>
								<div class="about-desc">
								We also learned that productivity is very personal, and this is seemingly true for everyone, not just self-employed people. We found this out when we asked people what is a productive day for them, and the answers are all over the places.
								</div>
							<li class="insights">Existing tools are not tailored for multitasking</li>
								<div class="about-desc">
								Most productivity tools on the market are not tailored for unpredictable work patterns that require frequent context switching. Even fewer try to address the issue of multitasking.

						<h1 class="title">Competitive analysis</h1>
						We looked at existing productivity and context management softwares to analysize existing solutions that tries to address this problem. The list includes Microsoft Focus Assist, Cold Turkey, FocusMe, Hocus Focus, Mindful Browsing, OmniFocus, and others. What we learned is that most of these products tries to address productivity and multitasking by <b>blocking out distractions or preventing users from context switching.</b>

						<br><br>

						One standout was the Virtual Desktop functionality on Windows 10. But what we realized was that Virtual Desktop is not often used by users because it is very time consuming to create and sort applications into the different desktops. We saw an opportunity to introduce AI as a way of automating this process. Specifically <b>Virtual Desktop does context switching very well, but context building is time consuming, and they don't tackle context keeping at all.</b>

						<div class="about-desc">
						<h1 class="title">Defining the strategy</h1>
						At this point we needed to generate ideas that fulfills the following roles — they need to address the problem of multitasking for our target audience of self-employed individuals. The product needs to be distinct from similar competitors. The design needs to be aligned with the use case of our user persona Erin. Based on the competitive analysis, we determined that the product needs to be able to build context quickly, keep the context, and also switch between these user-built contexts.

						<h2>What we tested</h2>
						Our objective for this prototype was to validate both the design concept, as well as the core features. So we created a video for participants to validate our design concept. The video follows the day in the life of a typical Chiron user - Ricardo, a freelance architect. I defined the specific story within the prototype, and advocated for the core features. Mengxiao and Sakshat created the prototype using Figma, and I produced the video using AfterEffects.

						<h1 class="title">Usability testing</h1>
						<h2>What we did</h2>
						After receiving the feedback, we made a number of changes to include into the mid-fidelity prototype. The objective for this phase was to flesh out the interaction design and test the specific execution of the features. 
						<Br><Br>
						We made a number of changes to the prototype in this iteration. We included a plugin marketplace to provide further personalization to the platform. We reworked the summary page and changed it to "last opened applications". We also updated the visual design using Microsoft's Fluent design system. Since Chiron is being branded as a Windows feature, it made sense for us to leverage the existing design patterns of Windows. 
						<Br><Br>
						We interviewed four participants in total to perform four main tasks. The prototype used for Usability Testing was created by Mengxiao in Principle. The prototype consisted of a "main application" in which you could view the timeline and project archive, and a "quick view" mode where you could create and switch between different activity containers.

						Also, we received feedback that the functionalities of these two parts were overlapped, but the visual inconsistency made them look like a light theme and a dark theme for a same thing. Because of this, we merged the overlay and the main application together in our high fidelity prototype. After that, these two parts became the main page view, and the activity archive view using the same visual language.
						<br><br>
						Our participants really couldn’t agree on whether the timeline should go left to right or right to left, and we received nearly 50/50 split on the “right” direction of the timeline. So instead we decided to orient the timeline from top to bottom instead, with top being the most recent.

							In the high fidelity prototype, we incorporated the learnings from the two previous rounds of testing, and consolidated the features to address the three design objectives of context building, context keeping, and context switching. Since the terminology is repetitive, we renamed them as "environment building", "context keeping", and "activity switching". 
							<br><br>
							We revisited Erin's story, and the final prototype is done from the point of view of Erin, who needs to balance her managerial work with personal obligations. Erin is planning her wedding and honeymoon, in addition to tracking the status of her employees and clients.

							The final prototype was created using Adobe AfterEffects by Khai Nguyen, with Sakshat and Mengxiao responsible for the assets used in the video. I was responsible for the content, script, and the technical documentation.
